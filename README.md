# Comparison Between Vitest, Jest and Mocha

This repo serves as a testing ground for Vitest, Jest and Mocha. You can compare performance strategies with each.

# Running the Tests

Some tests are located within a "src" folder, some are outside of it (within a "test" folder). The ones in the "src" folder belong to Jest / Vitest and will have a ".jest" or ".vitest" added to their names. I have preferred the pattern "name.jest.test.ts" for simplicity.
